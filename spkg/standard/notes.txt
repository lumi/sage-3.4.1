Sage-2.4 on my x86_64-Linux machine
(a bi-arch machine that can run either 32-bit or 64-bit)
had build problems for the two packages

    linbox-20070325 (specifically in linbox_wrap)
    sage_c_lib-2.4

In both cases, the cause was the same - a program
was trying to link the 32-bit library libstdc++ when it
should have used the equivalent 64-bit library.

We had seen this problem before (with givaro)
and the solution is the same.

1. Go to www.gnu.org/software/libtool and download the
latest snapshot of the stable branch of libtool. (Currently
libtool-1.5.23c)

2. Replace the macro AC_LIBTOOL_SYS_DYNAMIC_LINKER in
aclocal.m4 with the code for the same macro in libtool/acinclude.m4.

3. Remove configure

4. Run 'autoconf'.  This will create a new configure that
will use the new macro code.

With these two changes, sage-2.4 built on my x86_64-Linux machine
and passed all its tests.  (But the build also has the lattice_polytope.py
problem that I reported earlier.)
