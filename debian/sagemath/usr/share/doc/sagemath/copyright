Sage distributes a number of tarballs with the extension ".spkg" in
the spkg/standard subdirectory, some of which have different copyright
statuses.

The Sage Debian package has been created by removing the ".spkg" files
corresponding to packages already available in Debian.  Those that
remain are either parts of the core Sage distribution or are packages
that are not maintained outside of Sage.  The latter category
includes:

eclib
flintqs
rubiks
scipy_sandbox

The exception to this is that jmol and ipython1 have not yet made it
into Debian, but they have also been removed from this Sage
distribution.  This is because ipython1 is not used and jmol should
really be packaged separately.  Neither of them are used at all in
Sage by default.

The other exception is that this copy of the Sage source contains the
cython spkg, because the cython in Debian unstable at present does not
compile Sage 3.0.5.  This will change in future versions.

This source distribution can be reconstructed from the upstream sage
tarball by copying in the debian directory and then running

debian/rules prepare-source-tarball

This spkg has been modified by deleting the file procs/ressol.c, which
is from the LiDiA project, which supposedly has been relicensed under
the GPL.  However, there seems to be no documentation of this
relicensing, and the file is not used by eclib, so it has been
removed.

John Cremona no longer does eclib releases outside of updating the
Sage spkg, and thus it has not been packaged separately.

None of the packages in the rubiks spkg are under active development,
and thus it does not seem useful to package them independently from
Sage.

The delaunay package is part of the SciPy sandbox, and is thus not
part of a release of any software.  It is expected to be merged into
mainline SciPy in the future.  Because the future of delaunay as a
package external to SciPy is likely to be short, it has not been
separately packaged.

The arpack/ directory has been removed because it has the following

The flintqs spkg has the following copyright information:

Copyright: (C) 2006 William Hart and Jason Papadopoulos

and is licensed under the GPL, version 2 or higher.

Flintqs is to be superceded by the quadratic sieve implementation in
FLINT.  However, because the FLINT quadratic sieve is not compatible
with the old one, flintqs is still being used in Sage.  Because
Flintqs is no longer maintained, it has not been separately packaged.

  License

   THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS
   CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS
   PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK
   OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS
   PROHIBITED.

   BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND
   AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS
   LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE
   RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS
   AND CONDITIONS.

   1. Definitions
    a. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and
       other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation,
       derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a
       literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes
       cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may
       be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form
       recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that
       constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for
       the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the
       Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the
       synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image
       ("synching") will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of
       this License.
    b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such
       as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or
       broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works
       listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and
       arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations,
       in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form
       along with one or more other contributions, each constituting
       separate and independent works in themselves, which together are
       assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a
       Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined below)
       for the purposes of this License.
    c. "Creative Commons Compatible License" means a license that is
       listed at http://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses that has
       been approved by Creative Commons as being essentially equivalent
       to this License, including, at a minimum, because that license: (i)
       contains terms that have the same purpose, meaning and effect as
       the License Elements of this License; and, (ii) explicitly permits
       the relicensing of adaptations of works made available under that
       license under this License or a Creative Commons jurisdiction
       license with the same License Elements as this License.
    d. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and
       copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or
       other transfer of ownership.
    e. "License Elements" means the following high-level license
       attributes as selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of
       this License: Attribution, ShareAlike.
    f. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities
       that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.
    g. "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic
       work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created
       the Work or if no individual or entity can be identified, the
       publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the
       actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act,
       sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform
       literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the
       case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity
       who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and,
       (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits
       the broadcast.
    h. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the
       terms of this License including without limitation any production
       in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be
       the mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as
       a book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or
       other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical
       work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical
       composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which
       are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to
       cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture,
       sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which
       are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to
       photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan,
       sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography,
       architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a
       compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a
       copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus
       performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary
       or artistic work.
    i. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this
       License who has not previously violated the terms of this License
       with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission
       from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a
       previous violation.
    j. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work
       and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any
       means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public
       digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such
       a way that members of the public may access these Works from a
       place and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the
       Work to the public by any means or process and the communication to
       the public of the performances of the Work, including by public
       digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any
       means including signs, sounds or images.
    k. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including
       without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of
       fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage
       of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other
       electronic medium.

   2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce,
   limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from
   limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the
   copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.

   3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
   Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
   perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
   exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
    a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
       Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
       Collections;
    b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such
       Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes
       reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify
       that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a
       translation could be marked "The original work was translated from
       English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original
       work has been modified.";
    c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as
       incorporated in Collections; and,
    d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
    e. For the avoidance of doubt:
         i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those
            jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through
            any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived,
            the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such
            royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under
            this License;
        ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
            which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
            compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives
            the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise
            by You of the rights granted under this License; and,
        iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to
            collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that
            the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that
            administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society,
            from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this
            License.

   The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
   known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
   such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights
   in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not
   expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

   4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly
   made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
    a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the
       terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform
       Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the
       Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or
       impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this
       License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the
       rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License.
       You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices
       that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with
       every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You
       Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any
       effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the
       ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights
       granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This
       Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection,
       but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself
       to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a
       Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
       practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by
       Section 4(c), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon
       notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
       remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(c),
       as requested.
    b. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the
       terms of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this License
       with the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative
       Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a later license
       version) that contains the same License Elements as this License
       (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)); (iv) a Creative Commons
       Compatible License. If you license the Adaptation under one of the
       licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms of that
       license. If you license the Adaptation under the terms of any of
       the licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable
       License"), you must comply with the terms of the Applicable License
       generally and the following provisions: (I) You must include a copy
       of, or the URI for, the Applicable License with every copy of each
       Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II) You may not
       offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms
       of the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the
       Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under
       the terms of the Applicable License; (III) You must keep intact all
       notices that refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer
       of warranties with every copy of the Work as included in the
       Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV) when You
       Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose
       any effective technological measures on the Adaptation that
       restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to
       exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of
       the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation
       as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the
       Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to
       the terms of the Applicable License.
    c. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations
       or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant
       to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and
       provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i)
       the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if
       supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate
       another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing
       entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in
       Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other
       reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title
       of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably
       practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be
       associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the
       copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) ,
       consistent with Ssection 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a
       credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g.,
       "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay
       based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by
       this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner;
       provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection,
       at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all
       contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then
       as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as
       the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance
       of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for
       the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by
       exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly
       or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or
       endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
       Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without
       the separate, express prior written permission of the Original
       Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
    d. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
       otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute
       or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any
       Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify
       or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would
       be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation.
       Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which
       any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License
       (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion,
       mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to
       the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive
       or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent
       permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to
       reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License
       (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.

   5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

   UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR
   OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY
   KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,
   INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,
   FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF
   LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF
   ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW
   THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO
   YOU.

   6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
   LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR
   ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES
   ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR
   HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

   7. Termination
    a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
       automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
       Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or
       Collections from You under this License, however, will not have
       their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities
       remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6,
       7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
    b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here
       is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the
       Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to
       release the Work under different license terms or to stop
       distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such
       election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other
       license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the
       terms of this License), and this License will continue in full
       force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

   8. Miscellaneous
    a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a
       Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the
       Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You
       under this License.
    b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation,
       Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on
       the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under
       this License.
    c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
       applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability
       of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further
       action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be
       reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision
       valid and enforceable.
    d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
       breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in
       writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or
       consent.
    e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
       with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no
       understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the
       Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any
       additional provisions that may appear in any communication from
       You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written
       agreement of the Licensor and You.
    f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in
       this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne
       Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as
       amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the
       WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms
       Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised
       on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in
       the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to
       be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the
       implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable
       national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under
       applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted
       under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be
       included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict
       the license of any rights under applicable law.
